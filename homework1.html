<p class = "question">Homework1: For the three categories of web software technology we've just defined, you are asked to find out which category so-called "Netscape plug-in" technology belongs to. Please describe the basic idea of the technology, and give your reasoning on its position in the technology categories.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class = "answer">I think that the so-called “Netscape plug-in” technology belongs to the third category, namely Distributed Object Technology. Software objects A and B should be able to interplay/interoperable, regardless of<br />Time: "A" may be developed before "B", but it can call B's function.<br />Space: "A" and "B" may sit in different computers, but they can make use of each other's function.<br />Platform: "A" and "B" may be developed in different languages, with different operating systems, and compiled into different machine instruction sets, but they can call each other.<br />Awareness: "A" may not know "B"'s existence when it starts running, but somehow it can find "B" and invoke its function.<br />I don’t know the exact reason whether it belongs to the category. But it is obvious the technology could do nothing with the first two categories. And the technology can meet all the requirement above. So I think it belongs to the third category.</p>

<p class = "question">Homework2: In a normal intercommunication between Web browser and Web Server, Web Server closes the network communication right after it sends back the document requested by the browser. Think about this statusless character of World Wide Web. Give some good points and bad points of it. Can a web server know exactly how many browsers are reading its document?</p>
	
<blockquote>
	<p class = "answer">Good points<br />1.Sever can save sources for other usage.<br />2.There can be infinite browsers accessing to the same web server.<br />Bad points<br />1.Sever cannot know the status of which web browser accessing to the server.<br />2.Browser cannot know if the sever has broken down because it can still show the page before.<br />A web server cannot know the numbers of the web browsers which are reading its document.</p>
