<p class = "question">3. Tell the difference between a CGI program and a PHP program executed by a Web Server.</p>
	
<blockquote>
	<p class = "answer">A CGI program is completely formed by a certain script language, for example, perl. But a PHP program is embedded in HTML framework. In other words, you can use HTML grammer in .php file, but cannot use it in .pl file.<br />
