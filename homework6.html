<p class = "question">1.What are JavaScript browser sniffers?</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class = "answer">JavaScript Browser Sniffer is a browser identifier written in JavaScript and released under the LGPL license. It will tell which browser, version and operating system you (the visitor) are using (it's like phpsniff, but in JavaScript).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class = "question">2.Why are they so commonly used in javascripts?</p>
	
<blockquote>
	<p class = "answer">
		<ol>
			<li>Javascript gives straightforward access to objects of the DOM.</li>
			<li>Javascript cannot read/write to the local disk, so it's safe.</li>
			<li>Browsers have a JavaScript interpreter built-in, no plug-in is required. ——It's convenient.</li>
			<li>JavaScript can bring pages alive without the overhead of large downloads (e.g. applets, Flash, etc).</li>
		</ol>
