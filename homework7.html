<p class = "question">Homework4: Write a brief ( &lt;200 words) essay outlining the differences between AWT and Swing graphics.</p>
	
<blockquote>
	<p class = "answer">AWT is short for Abstract Window ToolKit, and this ToolKit supplys interface interacting with local GUI. When we use AWT to make up user GUI, we are actually using the graphic library that operating systems offer. But operating systems are different from each other, so we could not draw some graphs on this operating system while we could draw them on another oeprating system. But as we know, Java is operating system independent. So Java has to abandon some functions to make it true.<br />
	Swing is a new GUI system based on AWT. It can realize all the functions AWT offers, and augments more functions. Swing has simulated more graphs using basic graphic functions in AWT. And Swing make that by completely Java codes. So we can use new functions whatever operating system based on.<br />
    AWT draws graphs by local c/c++ programs. So AWT is fast. Swing is based on Java programs in AWT, so it's slower than AWT. In most aspects, Swing could do better than AWT. In fact Swing is more widely used indeed. But in some condition, for example, for a embedded application, AWT is firstly choosed because hardware resources are rare.</p>
